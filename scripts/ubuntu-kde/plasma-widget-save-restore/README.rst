.. code:: tip

    Save and restore Kubuntu Desktop (shortcuts, widgets, wallpaper, resolution, etc)

When you use Kubuntu with VirtualBox and the VirtualMahine resoultion is resize, the desktop move all shortcuts and widgets. Only two ways to fix the problem. On the one hand relocate each of the shortcuts and widgets manually. On the other save your desktop current status with saveplasma.sh and restore it after the problem occurred.
